# SimaKhanal_MiniAnalysis
**This repository is created to complete the mini data analysis part 1 and 2 as a part of STAT 545 A course.** 
The reository has three major folders: MDA1, MDA2 and Output_MDA2
1. MDA 1: consists of all the files (with codes) and graphs from the Mini Data Analysis Part 1
2. MDA 2: consists of ,.rmd and .md files (with codes) and graphs from the Mini Data Analysis Part 2
3. Output_MDA2: consists of .csv and .rds files which were the output of the model from MDA2.

# Description:

I selected the vancouver_trees dataset for both of my analysis.
For Analysis1:
1. The project explores how the diameter differs in two genus: Acer and Quercus? 
2. Next, the the cleaner dataset is created by checking the outliers of the data diameter of the quercus genus to analyse the diameter variable of the Quercus genus further. 
3. Afterthat the project explores if the diameter of the Quercus species is significantly affected by curb. 
4. At last, model is built to see if the diameters in each height class differ significantly.

For Analysis 2:
1. This project is about Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
2. Fitting a model object to the data, and extraction of a result.
3. Reading and writing data as separate files.
