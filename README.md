# SimaKhanal_MiniAnalysis
This repository is created to complete first milestones. 
I have done analysis of the vancouver trees. 
I have tried to explore how the diameter differs in two genus: Acer and Quercus? Next, I wanted a cleaner dataset and hence found the outliers of the data diameter of the quercus genus to analyse the diameter variable of the Quercus genus further. Afterthat I have explored if the diameter of the Quercus species is significantly affected by curb. At last, I have conducted regression to see if the diameters in each height class differ significantly.
